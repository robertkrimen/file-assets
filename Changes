 - Major "guts" rewrite. The interface is largely the same,
   but some heavy lifting had to be done to support different text/css media types.
 - Inline content is supported via ->include_content(...) or ->include(content => ...)
 - Passes through unrecognized attributes when generating HTML
 - Filters and output path selection is handled in a somewhat better (though not perfect, IMHO)
   fashion. Still need to write the documentation for this part.
